/// City search model

/// ## Architecture
///
/// It may seem overkill to have the model and repository implemented as separate objects. For this demo
/// this may be a valid criticism. However in a real world application, and even for our toy example, this
/// separation can be beneficial.
///
/// In our case we can separate the code that manages the search queue and rresults, from the logic that
/// produces our data. The result is that we end up with two simpler pieces of code which are easier to
/// reason about and test.
///

    /// value from the current value subject.
